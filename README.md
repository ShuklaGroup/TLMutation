# TLMutation

TLmutation: predicting the effects of mutations using transfer learning

TLmutation leverages deep mutational scanning datasets to predict the functional consequences of mutations in homologous proteins.

## 1. Model building
TLmutation first requires a model to represent the protein sequence. The current iteration of TLmutation uses a Pott's model and is built using the EVcouplings package.
